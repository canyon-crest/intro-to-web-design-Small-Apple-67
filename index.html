<p><img src="images/basketball.jpeg">My favorite sport to watch and play is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball" target="_blank">basketball</a>. I started playing basketball when I was around 4 years old, and I have played ever since. Basketball is a great sport because of how competitive and physical the sport is. You constantly need to improve your skills to become better than others, and that is really exciting for competitive players. Watching basketball is also very enjoyable, as the players are the most skilled in the world, and you can learn a lot from them.</p>

<h3>Favorite Show:</h3>
<p><img src="images/dbz.jpg">My favorite show is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z" target="_blank">Dragon Ball Z</a>. I enjoy how the main character grows in strength and grows as a person as well. He goes from a kid who doesn't know the consequences of killing to a man willing to spare even the most evil villains. The side characters are also given lots of time to shine and grow, which gives a more compelling story. The villains are also very well written, and the fight scenes are some of the greatest in any show. There are lots of emotion shown throughout the show, whether its through sacrifice or revenge.</p>

<h3>Favorite Video Game:</h3>
<p><img src="images/minecraft.jpg">My favorite video game is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Minecraft" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>. In Minecraft, you can do basically anything. You can play in survival and do your best to survive, or you could play in creative, where your only limitation is your creativeness. Every Minecraft world is different making each time playing different. You can also play with your friends, and compete in many different minigames. You can also download many different mods, to play even harder versions, or to add something more to your world.</p>
